COMPUTER MEMORY

The computer memory hold the data and instruction needed to process raw data and produce output

  volatile memory
  non volatile memory

On behalf of space & location divided memory in to 4 types

Register memory

A register is the smallest element for data holding. It is built-in directly in a processor, and thus, the registers act as
 certain memory locations that a processor can directly access in a computer.
The processor accesses register faster than the memory. Computers registers are accumulator register, program counter,
 instruction register, address register, etc.

Cache memory

       cache memory, also called cache, supplementary memory system that temporarily stores frequently used instructions 
and data for quicker processing by the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. The cache augments, and is an extension
 of, a computer's main memory.

Primary memory

Primary memory is computer memory that a processor or computer accesses first or directly. It allows a processor to access
 running execution .

Examples: RAM, ROM, Cache memory, PROM, EPROM, Registers, etc.	

Secondary memory

Secondary memory is computer memory that is non-volatile, persistent and not immediately accessible by a computer or
 processor. It allows users to store data and information that can be retrieved, transmitted, and used by apps and 
services quickly and easily. Secondary storage is another name for secondary memory.
Hard Drive, SSD, Flash, Optical Drive,USD Drive are some examples of secondary memories in computer
